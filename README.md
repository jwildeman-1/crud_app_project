# crud_app_project

After providing the store owner with an awesome barcode-scanning application, the store owner now asks you to provide an application which will help store managers keep track of their inventory of products. -- This is that app.

## Installation

Download the source code:

```shell
git clone remote_https://github.com/jwildeman-1/crud_app_project.git
cd C:\Users\Jason\Desktop\python-practice\crud>
```

Finally, download the [example `products.csv` file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-70-201706/master/projects/crud-app/products.csv) and save it as `data/products.csv`.

## Usage

```shell
python app/products_app.py
```
